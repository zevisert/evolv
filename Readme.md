## V1 developement repo for zevisert.ca

This repository once tracked changes for [evolv.zevisert.ca](), the development subdomain I was using before pushing to [zevisert.ca](http://zevisert.ca) while it was hosted on GoDaddy. I never found a way that I liked that allowed me to do my local developement and deploy to GoDaddy without changing anything about my workspace. This is mostly because I wasn't in control of the server they used (Apache), so I wasn't able to implement any sort of back-end, everything I had done was client-side.

Now I've moved to DigitalOcean, and I'm running a full stack - I've started anew. You can find the new repository over at [zevisert/encounter](https://github.com/zevisert/encounter)
