							<p>Welcome to the beginnings of zevisert.ca! This is an ongoing project of mine, eventually it will be a place were I write about fun things I've done, share code I've written, and host a small autobiography. There's not a whole lot here now, as I've been working on building and updating mostly. This website has seen recent changes to the following</p><br>
							<p>April 5th, 2016</p>
							<ul>
							<li><b>Buttons</b> - Buttons match the site style a bit better now! </li>
							<li><b>Blog 'Security'</b> - I began work on adding a simple security mechanism to my blog content, right now it's really easy to bypass if you know what you're doing..</li>
							<li><b>Blog posts</b> - I've actually written more blog posts! There's than one post there now! </li>
							</ul>
							<hr>
							<p>Feb 28th, 2016</p>
							<ul>
							<li><b>Favicons!</b> - Icons, icons everywhere! Now you should have proper resolutions for favicons in your browser, sharing links through facebook/pushbullet/twitter/etc, to shortcuts on your mobile device home screen (I know you want to)! </li>
							<li><b>Android Lollipop Multitasking</b> - Multitasking tabs are now styled to match my colorscheme!</li>
							<li><b>Footer</b> - I spent some time in illustrator and sketched out a fun little background footer, expect it to change. </li>
							<li><b>Blog Headers</b> - Fixed blog title images not showing, or showing the wrong image.</li>
							<li><b>About Links</b> - Added some links on my about page to help you reach me.</li>
							<li><b>Resizing</b> - Fixed display issues on smaller screens, where some text was appearing with one word per line.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Otherwise feel free to look around, and if you find something doens't seem right, let me know!</p>
